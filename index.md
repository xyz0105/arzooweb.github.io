# Nashville Zoo Scavenger Hunt
## A Zoo Adventure You've Never Seen Before!

**With the Nashville Zoo Scavenger Hunt, you'll be able to have a whole new zoo experience.**\
**Travel around the zoo and quiz yourself on what you've learned!**\
**Experience the animals in a whole new way with Augmented Reality!**\

Try scanning the signs of animals around the zoo! If the sign has the scientific name of the animal on it (like *Potamochoerus porcus*), the app should recognize the sign when you scan it and ask you questions about the animal. Answer the questions to score points and unlock portraits in the progress gallery!

Tips for if the app isn't recognizing the sign:
1. Make sure that the app says "Scanning..." at the top above your camera view.
2. Check that the sign has the scientific name of the animal. If none of the signs for that animal have the scientific name, try scanning the other signs.
3. Go back to the progress gallery and check if the animal is registered into the app. Most of the animals are, but some might be missing!
4. See if there is harsh glare or a deep shadow on the sign in the photo. Intense lighting, whether dark or light, can affect the app's ability to recognize the signs.
5. Fill the camera screen with the edges of the sign, making sure not to cut any out.
6. Try tilting your camera around a bit while focusing on the sign. Straight forwards should work best, but the angle may be a little off.
7. Consult someone else! Ask a member of the SSMV Zoo App group or the zoo staff.

Tap on an unlocked gallery portrait with a **green** border to activate the Augmented Reality Projector. Tap on the camera screen's view of the ground to place that animal in 3D space! Walk around the animal to view it from multiple perspectives.

If you have issues placing animals with the Augmented Reality Projector, check if your mobile device is on [this list.](https://library.vuforia.com/articles/Solution/vuforia-fusion-supported-devices.html) Incompatible devices will still be able to use all other features of the app, but unable to project the animals. If your device is on the list and you continue experiencing issues, please consult a member of the SSMV Zoo App group or the zoo staff.
